greenhouse
==========
This code goes along with a DIY hardware that opens and closes greenhouse windows according to temperature, humidity and wind measurements. The hardware explanation is currently published only in Estonian language http://libahunt.ee/et/kasvuhoone-automaatika, but if you watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mts2b0E6m1w and read code comments you should be able to make sense of it. Likely an English version will get published some time too.
